# Predicting Price Moves with News Sentiment
# Predicting Price Moves with News Sentiment

This project explores how financial news sentiment influences stock price movements. It integrates natural language processing (NLP) with time-series data from stock markets to build models that forecast short-term price direction. 

I perform:
- Sentiment analysis on real-world news headlines
- Technical analysis of historical stock prices
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Predictive modeling and performance evaluation

The goal is to uncover patterns in market behavior driven by public sentiment, and to build tools that could support algorithmic trading or market monitoring.
