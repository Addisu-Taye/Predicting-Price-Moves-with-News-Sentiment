# Predicting Price Moves with News Sentiment
This project explores how financial news sentiment and technical indicators can be used to analyze and predict short-term stock price movements.

The analysis is based on:

A large dataset of financial news headlines (over 1.4 million entries)
Historical stock data for 7 major tech companies
Tools like pandas, nltk, pynance, and TA-Lib
üìå Overview
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that perform the following:

Analyze financial news headlines for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
Extract technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and ATR
Investigate correlations between news sentiment and stock price changes
The goal is to understand whether news sentiment has a measurable impact on stock prices and how technical indicators can help identify market trends.

Export to Sheets
Conclusion: Sentiment shows very weak positive correlation with daily range and a slightly negative link with closing prices ‚Äî indicating limited predictive power when used alone.

üß† Key Findings
Most headlines are neutral, suggesting conservative reporting or lack of strong opinions.
Tech stocks show high inter-correlations, especially Apple and Microsoft.
Meta experienced a sustained upward trend after layoffs in late 2022 and its first dividend announcement in early 2024.
Tesla showed high volatility linked to external events such as Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter.
Technical indicators like MACD and RSI were effective in identifying bullish/bearish momentum.
Sentiment alone had minimal direct impact on short-term stock prices.
üìù Recommendations
Expand the news dataset beyond 2020 to improve sentiment‚Äìprice correlation analysis.
Continue using technical indicators for trading decisions in volatile markets.
Publishers should focus on timely coverage of major global economic events.
‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced
Difficulty installing libraries like TA-Lib.
Limited availability of news data after 2020.
Large datasets required processing via Google Colab due to memory constraints.
